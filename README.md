This is a Python script that uses speech recognition and the OpenAI GPT-3 API to convert spoken questions into written text and generate responses to those questions. The script records audio from the user's microphone, transcribes the audio to text using the Google Speech Recognition API, and then sends the text to the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate a response.

Installation

Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt
Add your OpenAI API key to the openai.api_key variable in the speech_to_text.py script.

Usage

Run the script using python speech_to_text.py
Say "Genius" to start recording your question
